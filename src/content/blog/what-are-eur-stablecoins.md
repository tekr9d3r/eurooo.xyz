# What Are EUR Stablecoins? A Complete Guide

Euro stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the Euro (€). Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, EUR stablecoins aim to hold a stable value, making them ideal for everyday transactions, savings, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

## Why EUR Stablecoins Matter

For European users, EUR stablecoins offer several key advantages:

- **No currency conversion fees**: Avoid paying 1-3% fees when converting from USD stablecoins
- **Reduced forex risk**: Your holdings stay denominated in your home currency
- **Regulatory clarity**: MiCA-compliant stablecoins offer stronger consumer protections
- **DeFi access**: Earn yield on your Euros without leaving the crypto ecosystem

> **Key Fact**: The EUR stablecoin market has grown to over €500 million in total value locked across DeFi protocols as of 2026.

## How EUR Stablecoins Maintain Their Peg

EUR stablecoins use different mechanisms to stay pegged to €1:

1. **Fiat-backed**: Issuers like Circle (EURC) hold actual Euros in bank accounts. Each token is redeemable for €1.

2. **Over-collateralized**: Some protocols back EUR tokens with crypto collateral worth more than the tokens issued.

3. **Algorithmic**: Smart contracts automatically adjust supply based on demand (less common for EUR).
